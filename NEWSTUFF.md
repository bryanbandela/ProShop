I. Remove git file in the frontend folder created by react
We want our git file in the root of the folder

- ls -a (to see all the files including the hidden ones)
- rm -rf .git

II. Shortcut (With ES7 React ... )

- rafce : to create a react component with arrow function (Thanks to ES7 React,etc)

- race : React Arrow-function Component Export

III. Link

the Link component from react-router-dom does not reload the page and hence it's faster unlike the "a" tag

IV. React-bootstrap
To keep the image to go over the container
